          When booking taxis to and from High House please ensure your location is noted as High House Wedding Venue. <br />
          This ensures our local neighbours are not disturbed when guests and taxis are locating the venue. <br />
          Unfortunately Google Maps and Sat Nav systems can be unclear as to our exact location and will generally take you too far. <br />
          Please look out for our entrance rather than relying on these.
